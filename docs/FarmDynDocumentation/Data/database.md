# Database

The database is located in the *\dat* folder and contains all the relevant information used in FarmDyn. It contains country or region specific agronomic, policy or emission data, which are denominated with the suffix of the corresponding country. In the example below, you can see files denominated with a suffix *\_de* for Germany (Deutschland) and *\_no* for Norway. Further, most data files are written in the *.gms* files, however, some of the data is coming from pre-processing steps and are given by .gdx files.

In addition to the data used in the agronomic, policy and emission domain of FarmDyn, the farm population can be generated in the file *farmData_de.gms* or any copy of it to generate a *gdx* file with the farm population.
