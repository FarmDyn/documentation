# Abstract Policy Measures


Farmdyn covers a wide variety of agri- and agri-environmental policies. This includes the first pillar of the most recent CAP (currently under construction), agri-environmental schemes, and the German implementation of the Nitrate Directive. It further models country specific policies for non-EU countries such as Switzerland and Norway.
