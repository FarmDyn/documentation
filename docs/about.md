The dynamic single farm model FARMDYN documented in here presents a
framework which allows simulating in farm management and investment
under changes in boundary conditions such as prices or policy
instruments, for a wide range of different farming systems found in
Germany and beyond. Given the complex interplay of management and
investment decisions - such as adjustments of herd sizes, crop shares
and yields, feeding practise, fertilizer management and manure treatment
-- FARMDYN is implemented as a fully dynamic bio-economic simulation
model template building on Mixed-Integer Programming. It is complemented
by a Graphical User Interface to steer simulations and to exploit
results.

The framework is the outcome of several research activities. Its first
version (named DAIRYDYN) was developed in the context of a research
project financed by the German Science Foundation focusing in marginal
abatement costs of dairy farms in. That project contributed the overall
concept and the highly detailed description of dairy farming and GHG
accounting, while it had only a rudimentary module for arable cropping.
That version of the model was used by Garbert (2013) as
the starting point to develop a version for pig farms, however with far
less detail with regard to feeding options compared to cattle.
Garbert also developed a first phosphate accounting
module. Activities in spring 2013 for a scientific paper
(Remble et al. 2013) contributed a first version with
arable crops differentiated by intensity level and tillage type, along
with more detailed machinery module which also considered plot size and
mechanisation level effect on costs and labour needs. Based on nitrogen
response functions, nitrogen loss factors were differentiated for the
different intensity and related yield levels. After these extensions the
model was renamed to FARMDYN (farm dynamic). David Sch√§fer, then a
master student, developed in 2014 a bio-gas module for the model which
reflects the German renewable energy legislation. In 2016, an extension
allowing for stochastic programming was added.
