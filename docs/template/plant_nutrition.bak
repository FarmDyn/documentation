# Plant Nutrition


The equations related to the plant nutrition make sure that the nutrient
need of crops is met. Nutrient need can be derived from N response
functions or from planning data for fixed yield levels. Furthermore, Farmdyn
is loosely connected to the crop modelling framework Simplace which provides data on
cropping activities. Needed nutrients are provided by manure and synthetic fertilizer.

@Rienne: Bitte den ersten Abschnitt ("The equation related...") als Zusammenfassung markieren.

The template supports two differently detailed ways to account for plant
nutrition need.

1.  A **fixed factor approach** with yearly nutrient balances per crop

    a.  Using N response curves

    b.  Using planning data

2.  Using data output of the crop modelling framework SIMPLACE

*p\_nutNeed* is the nutrient need for different crops and enters the
equation for fixed factor approach and the flow model. For the fixed
factor approach, nutrient need can be calculated based on N response
curves and alternatively based on planning data. In the detailed flow
model, nutrient need needs to be calculated based on N response curves.
All relevant calculation can be found in *coeffgen\\cropping.gms*.

## The fixed factor approach

The fixed factor approach is used in combination with the use of N response curves
and planning data. Generally, the plant need in p_nutneed has to be met with manure and
chemical fertilizer. There is the option to allow manure application over plant need as
manure nutrients on livestock farms with high stocking densities partly are waste.

@Rienne - add equation nutbalcrop_ from templ.gms


## N response curves

The yield level of different crops is chosen in the GUI. The following
equations show, at the example of winter cereals, that the yield,
*p\_OCoeffC*, equals the yield given by the GUI, *p\_cropYieldInt* , and
takes a growth rate given by the GUI into account.

[embedmd]:# (N:/em/work1/FarmDyn/FarmDyn_QM/gams/regionalData/yields.gms GAMS /p_OCoeffC\("winterCere"/ /;/)
```GAMS
p_OCoeffC("winterCere",soil,till,intens,"winterCere",t)     $ sum(soil_plot(soil,plot),c_s_t_i("winterCere",plot,till,intens))       =  8   * (1.00 + p_cropYieldInt("winterCere","GrowthRateY")/100) **t.pos;
```

In the next step, the nutrient need for crops are linked to the
different cropping intensities. There are five different intensity
levels with regard the amount of N fertilizer applied:

[embedmd]:# (N:/em/work1/FarmDyn/FarmDyn_QM/gams/model/templ_decl.gms GAMS /set\sintens/ /;/)
```GAMS
set intens      / normal   "Full N fertilization"
                    fert80p  "80 % N"
                    fert60p  "60 % N"
                    fert40p  "40 % N"
                    fert20p  "20 % N"

                    bales
                    silo
                    Graz

                    /;
```


These nutrient needs for the different intensities are based on nitrogen
response functions from field trials. The intensity can be reduced from
100 % to an N fertilizer application of 80 %, 60 %, 40 % and 20 %. The
yield level is reduced to 96 %, 90 %, 82 % and 73 %, respectively. These
steps reflect the diminishing yield increases from increased N
fertilizer application.

[embedmd]:# (N:/em/work1/FarmDyn/FarmDyn_QM/gams/coeffgen/cropping.gms GAMS /p_OCoeffC.*?"fert80p"/ /0\.53;/)
```GAMS

    p_OCoeffC(arabCrops,soil,till,"fert60p",prods,t) $ (not sameas(till,"eco"))   = p_oCoeffC(arabCrops,soil,till,"normal",prods,t) * 0.90;
    p_OCoeffC(arabCrops,soil,till,"fert40p",prods,t) $ (not sameas(till,"eco"))   = p_oCoeffC(arabCrops,soil,till,"normal",prods,t) * 0.82;
    p_OCoeffC(arabCrops,soil,till,"fert20p",prods,t) $ (not sameas(till,"eco"))   = p_oCoeffC(arabCrops,soil,till,"normal",prods,t) * 0.73;

    p_OCoeffC(arabCrops,soil,till,"fert80p",prods,t) $ (not sameas(till,"eco"))   = p_oCoeffC(arabCrops,soil,till,"normal",prods,t) * 0.95;
    p_OCoeffC(arabCrops,soil,till,"fert60p",prods,t) $ (not sameas(till,"eco"))   = p_oCoeffC(arabCrops,soil,till,"normal",prods,t) * 0.85;
    p_OCoeffC(arabCrops,soil,till,"fert40p",prods,t) $ (not sameas(till,"eco"))   = p_oCoeffC(arabCrops,soil,till,"normal",prods,t) * 0.71;
    p_OCoeffC(arabCrops,soil,till,"fert20p",prods,t) $ (not sameas(till,"eco"))   = p_oCoeffC(arabCrops,soil,till,"normal",prods,t) * 0.53;
```


The output coefficients, *p\_OCoeffC*, represents the yields per hectar.
They are used to define the nutrient uptake by the crops, *p\_nutNeed,*
based on the nutrient content, *p\_nutContent*. Values for
*p\_nutContent* are taken from the German fertilizer directive
(DüV 2007, Appendix 1).

[embedmd]:# (N:/em/work1/FarmDyn/FarmDyn_QM/gams/coeffgen/cropping.gms GAMS /\s\sp_nutNeed\(c.*?nut.*?\$/ /;/)
```GAMS

 p_nutNeed(crops,soil,till,intens,nut,t) $ sum(soil_plot(soil,plot), c_s_t_i(crops,plot,till,intens))
        = sum( prods, p_OCoeffC(crops,soil,till,intens,prods,t) * (p_nutContent(crops,prods,nut)*10));
```

For different intensities, the corresponding amount of nutrient applied
has to be determined to fulfil the need *p\_nutNeed*.

The parameter *p\_basNut* defines the amount of nutrients coming from
other sources than directly applied fertilizer. The curve suggests that
for a 53%-level of yield, only 20% of the N dose at full yield is
necessary. Assuming a minimum nutrient loss factor that allows defining
how much N a crop takes up from other sources (mineralisation,
atmospheric deposition):

[embedmd]:# (N:/em/work1/FarmDyn/FarmDyn_QM/gams/coeffgen/cropping.gms GAMS /p_basNut\(crops.*?nut.*?\$.*?\$/ /;/)
```GAMS
p_basNut(crops,soil,till,nut,t) $ (sum(prods, p_OCoeffC(crops,soil,till,"normal",prods,t)) $ sameas(nut,"N"))
       = smax( (soil_plot(soil,plot),c_s_t_i(crops,plot,till,"normal"),intens),
           sum(prods, p_OCoeffC(crops,soil,till,intens,prods,t) * (p_nutContent(crops,prods,nut)*10))
             - p_nutNeed(crops,soil,till,"normal",nut,t)*(1 + p_FracGaseF + p_FracLeach) * (  0.2 $ sameas(intens,"fert20p")
                                                                                            + 0.4 $ sameas(intens,"fert40p")
                                                                                            + 0.6 $ sameas(intens,"fert60p")
                                                                                            + 0.8 $ sameas(intens,"fert80p")
                                                                                            + 1.0 $ sameas(intens,"normal")) );
```

The amount of nutrient applied, *p\_nutApplied,* is estimated as shown
in the following equation, it is assumed that at least 20% of the
default leaching and NH<sub>3</sub> losses will occur.

```GAMS

    = p_nutNeed(crops,soil,till,"normal","N",t)*(1 + p_FracGaseF + p_FracLeach)*0.2;
```

    = p_nutNeed(crops,soil,till,"normal","N",t)*(1 + p_FracGaseF + p_FracLeach)*0.2 * 1.5;
```

[embedmd]:# (N:/em/work1/FarmDyn/FarmDyn_QM/gams/coeffgen/cropping.gms GAMS /p_nutApplied.*?"fert60p"/ /;/)
```GAMS

```

[embedmd]:# (N:/em/work1/FarmDyn/FarmDyn_QM/gams/coeffgen/cropping.gms GAMS /p_nutApplied.*?"fert80p"/ /;/)
```GAMS
p_nutApplied(crops,soil,till,"fert80p","N",t) $ sum(soil_plot(soil,plot),c_s_t_i(crops,plot,till,"fert80p"))
    = p_nutNeed(crops,soil,till,"normal","N",t)*(1 + p_FracGaseF + p_FracLeach)*0.2 * 2.5;
```

[embedmd]:# (N:/em/work1/FarmDyn/FarmDyn_QM/gams/coeffgen/cropping.gms GAMS /p_nutApplied.*?"normal"/ /;/)
```GAMS
p_nutApplied(crops,soil,till,"normal","N",t)  $ sum(soil_plot(soil,plot),c_s_t_i(crops,plot,till,"normal") )
    = p_nutNeed(crops,soil,till,"normal","N",t)*(1 + p_FracGaseF + p_FracLeach)*0.2 * 3;
```

The nutrient application, *p\_nutApplied,* in combination with the basis
delivery from soil and air, *p\_basNut,* allows defining the loss rates
for each intensity level, *p\_nutLossUnavoidable,* as the difference
between the deliveries and the nutrient uptake, *p\_nutNeed,* by the
plants:

[embedmd]:# (N:/em/work1/FarmDyn/FarmDyn_QM/gams/coeffgen/cropping.gms GAMS /\s\sp_nutLossUnavoidable\(s.*?nut/ /;/)
```GAMS
  p_nutLossUnavoidable(soil,till,intens,nut)
     $ (sum( (crops,t) $ p_nutNeed(crops,soil,till,intens,nut,t), 1))
      =  sum( (crops,t) $ p_nutNeed(crops,soil,till,intens,nut,t),
           max(0,Min(50, p_nutApplied(crops,soil,till,intens,nut,t)
                 + p_basNut(crops,soil,till,nut,t) - p_nutNeed(crops,soil,till,intens,nut,t)))
              / p_nutNeed(crops,soil,till,intens,nut,t))

        /sum( (crops,t) $ p_nutNeed(crops,soil,till,intens,nut,t), 1);
```

*p\_nutLossUnavoidable* enters the Standard Nutrient Fate Model (see
chapter 2.11.2). It represents the factor that has to be applied over
the plant removal, *p\_nutNeed*, to reach a certain yield level. It
indicates the nutrient efficiency of the fertilizer management.

## Planning Data

The nutrient need can also derived from planning data from the revised
Fertilizer directive (BMEL 2015). The proposed directive includes
compulsory fertilizer planning to increase N use efficiency on farms.
This measure is included in FARMDYN. When fertilizer management follows
the planning data, different intensities do not exist and yield levels
are fixed, i.e. cannot be changed by the GUI.

The yield level *p\_OCoeffC* is fixed in the following equation, showing
the example of winter cereals.

[embedmd]:# (N:/em/work1/FarmDyn/FarmDyn_QM/gams/coeffgen/cropping.gms GAMS /\s\s[^\n]\sp_OCoeffC\("winterW/ /;/)
```GAMS

   p_OCoeffC("winterWheat",soil,till,intens,"winterWheat",t)   $ sum(soil_plot(soil,plot),c_s_t_i("winterWheat",plot,till,intens))      =  8   ;
```

The yield corresponds to a certain amount of needed N, *p\_nutNeed*,
given by the directive.

[embedmd]:# (N:/em/work1/FarmDyn/FarmDyn_QM/gams/coeffgen/cropping.gms GAMS /p_nutNeed\("winter/ /;/)
```GAMS
p_nutNeed("winterWheat",soil,till,intens,"N",t)   $ sum(soil_plot(soil,plot), c_s_t_i("winterWheat",plot,till,intens))  =   230 - p_basNut("winterWheat",soil,till,"N",t)   ;
```

In the case of P, it is assumed that the nutrients need correspond to
the nutrients removed by the harvested product.

[embedmd]:# (N:/em/work1/FarmDyn/FarmDyn_QM/gams/coeffgen/cropping.gms GAMS /\s\sp_nutNeed\(c.*?"P"/ /;/)
```GAMS
  p_nutNeed(crops,soil,till,intens,"P",t) $ sum(soil_plot(soil,plot), c_s_t_i(crops,plot,till,intens))
        = sum( prods, p_OCoeffC(crops,soil,till,intens,prods,t) * (p_nutContent(crops,prods,"P")*10));
```

The directive prescribes that nutrients delivered from soil and air have
to be taken into account. This reduces the amount of fertilizer that
needs to be applied, p_nutNeed is lowered.
`

[embedmd]:# (N:/em/work1/FarmDyn/FarmDyn_QM/gams/coeffgen/cropping.gms GAMS /\s[^\n]\sp_basNut\(c.*?[^\$]"N"/ /p_NfromLegumes\(crops\);/)
```GAMS
   p_basNut(crops,soil,till,"N",t) $ arableCrops(crops) =  50 ;
   p_basNut(crops,soil,till,"N",t) $ grassCrops(crops)  =  10 + p_NfromLegumes(crops);
```


## Using data output of the crop modelling framework SIMPLACE

Farmdyn is loosley connected to the crop modelling framework Simplace (@Rienne: add link
http://www.simplace.net/Joomla/index.php). The crop model provides cropping activities consisting of
different managements and corresponding yields and externalities. They are provided as a gdx file
and loaded into Farmdyn.
The parameter p_simres contains all information from the crop model for
differen crops, crop rotations (represented in the set till) and intensities. Intensities represent a whole
range of management, consisting of different amounts of fertilizer, straw removal and catch crop growing. The elements of
the set @Till add setname contain the information on yields and externalities for the different cropping activities.
The use of the Simplace data is activated in the GUI by selecting the BWA mode. It requires to choce specific farm types
and their location in different soil-climate regions. Currently, Simplace data are available for the German federal state
of North Rhine-Westphalia.

First, the shares of different crops in Farmdyn have to equal the crop rotation represetend in
the Simplace data. Crop rotations can be selected at the GUI.

@Rienne: add SimplaceRot_ from model\simplace_module.gms

The synthetic fertilizer need linked to cropping activities in the Simplace data has to be provided
by synthetic fertilizer distribution in Farmdyn.

 @Rienne: add NMineralSim_ from model\simplace_module.gms

The manure application in spring linked to cropping activies in the Simplace data has to be provided
by manure application in Farmdyn in the months January to June. Note that other restrictions such as
the Fertilzation Ordinance may restrict application in certain months.

@Rienne: add NOrgSpringSim_ from model\simplace_module.gms

The manure application in autumn linked to cropping activies in the Simplace data has to be provided
by manure application in Farmdyn in the months July to December.

@Rienne: add NOrgAutumnSim_ from model\simplace_module.gms

The cropping activities provided by Simplace do not contain information of P2O5 (@Rienne: Ziffern bitte tief stellen) fertilizer need. Therefore,
the following equation ensures that P2O5 (@Rienne: Ziffern bitte tief stellen) removal with the harvested product has to be meet by P2O5 (@Rienne: Ziffern bitte tief stellen) in manure and
chemical fertilizer.

@Rienne: add PFertilizingSim_ from model\simplace_module.gms

Some crops require minimum chemical fertilizer doses such as the starter fertilization of maize. For N, minimum
chemical fertilizer needs are reflected in the Simplace results. For P2O5, the following equations ensures that
the minimum chemical fertilizer needs are met.

@Rienne: add MinChemFertSimplace_ from model\simplace_module.gms

The Simplace results contains scenarios, captured in the set intensities, with and without residue removal. Therebey, it is assumed that straw from
cereal production can be sold. The following equation maps the croping activities on the variable v_residuesRemoval
which is used in other parts of Farmdyn to calculate the costs and revenues related to residue removal.

@Rienne: add ResidRemovalSim_  from model\simplace_module.gms

The Simplace results contain scenarios, captured in the set intensities, with and without catch crops.
They are linked to the catch crop growing represented in v_cropHa.

@Rienne: add CatchCropsSimHa_ from model\simplace_module.gms

The Simplace results contain nitrate leaching for the different cropping activities. This externality is
summarized in the following equation for the environmental accounting in Farmdyn.

@Rienne: add NleachSim_ from model\simplace_module.gms

Furthermore, the Simplace results contain an N balance which is summarized in the following equation. Please note
that the calculation of this balance differs from the balance calculation under the Fertilization Ordinance.

@Rienne: add NleachSim_ from model\simplace_module.gms
