# Model development

## Projects

The application and extension of FARMDYN is part of several ongoing
research activities at ILR, in cooperation with international and
national partners.

-   The project ["Modeling structural change and agricultural nutrient
    flows across scales in regions of North
    Rhine-Westphalia"](/em/rsrch/usl_e.htm), financed by MKULNV
    (Ministry for environment and agriculture, state of North
    Rhine-Westphalia) aims at the analysis of nutrient exchanges between
    farms in regions of North Rhine-Westphalia based on the combination
    of FARMDYN with bio-physical and agent based modeling. The project
    is carried out by the chair of Production Economics and Resource and
    Environmental Economics at ILR and the Institute of Crop Science and
    Resource Conservation (2016-2018).
-   In the project [Understanding spatial interactions and structural
    change in the dairy production chain with a dynamic regional Agent
    Based Model covering dairy farms and dairy
    processing](/agpo/rsrch/dfg-dairystruct/dfgdairystruct_e.htm),
    financed by DFG, dual profit functions for different farming systems
    are estimated from FARMDYN simulations to source an Agent Based
    Model (2015-2018).
-   Different plant protection strategies are implemented in FARMDYN in
    the context of the PhD thesis of Thomas Böcker (since 2016).
-   The FARMDYN team in Bonn and a group at [INRA,
    Clermont-Ferrand](http://www1.clermont.inra.fr/urh/index.php/en/general/show/id/18)
    merge their detailed farm scale models. For FARMDYN, that will mean
    more detail for grass management and a better representation of beef
    cattle systems, as well as a parameterization for French conditions
    (since 2016).

The original model version was developed in the project ["The relation
between indicators for the crediting of emission rights and abatement
costs - a systematic modeling approach for dairy
farms"](/agpo/rsrch/dfg-ghgabat/dfgabat_e.htm), financed by the German
Science Foundation and carried out by Karin Holm-Müller, Wolfgang Britz,
Bernd Lengers and David Schäfer. In the context of the pdh-thesis of
Johanna Budde, a first version of the pig module was developed
(2012-2013).

    fertilization, related environmental indicators and regulations such
    as the German Fertilizer Directive
-   [David Schäfer](/em/staff/schaefer/schaefer_e.htm), biogas module,
    improved pig module, link to ABM
-   Thomas Böcker, plant protection
    strategies
-   [Christoph Pahmeyer](/em/staff/pahmeyer/pahmeyer_e.htm), beef fattening module, solid manure
    strategies

-   Bernd Lengers (2011-2014), main contributor of original model
    version, GHG indicators
