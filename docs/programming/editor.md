# Choosing an editor and making it FarmDyn compatible

As you already know, FarmDyn is written in the algebraic modeling language [GAMS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Algebraic_Modeling_System).
Since the model is quiet large, the code is split up into several files ([called seperation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)) within the `gams` folder of your FarmDyn checkout.
A GAMS file is just a plain text file with a `.gms` suffix, and can therefore be edited by a number of plain text editors.

Apparantly, there is no obvious right or wrong choice for such an editor.
In the following subsections we will cover some of the most popular options. However, the list is neither complete nor completly objective (I'm sorry).
Eventually, you have to decide which one suits your needs by weighing the pros and cons, as all of them are capable of getting the job done the one or the other way.
