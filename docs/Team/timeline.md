 <!--
The framework of FarmDyn is the outcome of several research activities. Its first version (named DAIRYDYN) was developed in the context of a research project financed by the German Science Foundation focusing in marginal abatement costs of dairy farms. The project contributed the overall concept and the highly detailed description of dairy farming and GHG accounting, while it had only a rudimentary module for arable cropping. This early version of the model was used by Garbert (2013) as the starting point to develop a module to depict pig farms, however with less detailed feeding options compared to the cattle module. Garbert also developed a first phosphate accounting module. Activities in spring 2013 for a scientific paper (Remble et al. 2013) contributed a first version with arable crops differentiated by intensity level and tillage type, along with a more detailed machinery module which also considered plot size and mechanization and their respective effect on costs and labour needs. Based on nitrogen response functions, nitrogen loss factors were differentiated for the different intensity and related yield levels. After these extensions the model was renamed to FarmDyn (farm dynamic). David Schäfer, then a master student, developed in 2014 a bio-gas module for the model which reflects the German renewable energy legislation. In 2016, an extension allowing for stochastic programming was added. Since then FarmDyn is a substantial part of several ongoing research projects across Europe. The existing modules are therefore under constant revision and supplemented by new ones.

                        <p>Bernd Lengers and Wolfgang Britz released the first version of the model - then named DairyDyn. DairyDyn was the result of a research and PhD project finaced by the German Sciece Foundation and focused on the marginal abatement costs of dairy farming. Consequently, dairy farming and GHG accounting were depicted in detail, while the model only had a rudimentary module for arable cropping. The model also included a first meta-modelling version for the development of a marginal abatement cost function estimation routine including establishing experiment runs with design of experiments.</p>

                        <p>In his Master thesis, David Schäfer extended DairyDyn with the biogas module reflecting the German renewable energy legislation differentiating between different size classes and subsidies schemes. Within this framework, the pig branch was also extended to cover different feeding phases of fattening pigs and corresponding excretion levels. Futher, sow and pig fattening farm branches were separated.</p>
