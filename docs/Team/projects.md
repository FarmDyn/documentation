# Introduction

From it's development in the DFG project "The relation between indicators for the crediting of emission rights and abatement costs - a systematic modeling approach for dairy farms", FarmDyn has constantly progressed in various projects. Initially only simulating a dairy farm model parameterized for the German condition, it is now covering a variety of farm branches with parameterizations for the Netherlands, Norway, Germany and Switzerland. In the following you will find the current and past projects, where FarmDyn was further developed or was used.

##MIND STEP (2019-2023)
![](../media/Projects/MindStep.jpg){: style="width:200px", align="left"}
The European Union’s future Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) plays a pivotal role in developing a sustainable agricultural sector. The future CAP will be more flexible and adaptable to the needs of EU Member States and the individual decision making (IDM) units in the sector. To achieve this Member States develop strategic plans for the CAP that should define measurable objectives and means to achieve them. The EU-funded MIND STEP project will make use of agricultural and biophysical data and include individual decision making (IDM) unity in new and existing policy models for impact assessments. Using agricultural statistics and big datasets, the new IDM models will be estimated and calibrated, drawing on established economic and evolving machine learning techniques.

Climplement aims to develop knowledge and processes to ensure successful implementation and diffusion of on-farm GHG reducing management models in Norwegian agriculture.

#Past Projects

##LIFT (2018-2022)
![](../media/Projects/LIFT.jpg){: style="width:200px", align="left"}
FARMDYN was used in the H2020 project LIFT (Low-Input Farming and Territories - Integrating knowledge for improving ecosystem-based farming) by the team in Bonn and a team at INRA, Rennes, to compare different farming systems with regard to sustainability indicators.

##SustainBeef (2017-2020)
![](../media/Projects/SUSTAINBEEF.jpg){: style="width:200px", align="left"}
The 3-year ERA-NET project SUSTAINBEEF, jointly funded by the EU and the BMEL, links researcher focusing on beef production system with stakeholders to develop and assess innovative ways to improve the sustainability of beef production system. FarmDyn is used for a detailed, quantiative bio-eonomic analysis of beef production systems in Germany based on the application. Further, the core group provided support to partners in applying the model to study regions in their own country.

##USL Project (2016-2019) - Modeling structural change and agricultural nutrient flows across scales in regions of North Rhine-Westphalia", 2016-2019
The project analyzed nutrient exchanges between farms in regions of North Rhine-Westphalia based on the combination of FARMDYN with bio-physical and agent based modeling.

##DFG Project (2015-2018) - Understanding spatial interactions and structural change in the dairy production chain with a dynamic regional Agent-Based Model covering dairy farms and dairy processing
Dual profit functions for different farming systems were estimated from FARMDYN simulations to source an Agent Based Model

##DFG Project (2010-2014)- The relation between indicators for the crediting of emission rights and abatement costs - a systematic modeling approach for dairy farms
The original model version was developed in the project "The relation between indicators for the crediting of emission rights and abatement costs - a systematic modeling approach for dairy farms", financed by the German Science Foundation and carried out by Karin Holm-Müller, Wolfgang Britz, Bernd Lengers and David Schäfer. In the context of the pdh-thesis of Johanna Budde, a first version of the pig module was developed (2012-2013).
