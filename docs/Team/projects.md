 <!--
The framework of FarmDyn is the outcome of several research activities. Its first version (named DAIRYDYN) was developed in the context of a research project financed by the German Science Foundation focusing in marginal abatement costs of dairy farms. The project contributed the overall concept and the highly detailed description of dairy farming and GHG accounting, while it had only a rudimentary module for arable cropping. This early version of the model was used by Garbert (2013) as the starting point to develop a module to depict pig farms, however with less detailed feeding options compared to the cattle module. Garbert also developed a first phosphate accounting module. Activities in spring 2013 for a scientific paper (Remble et al. 2013) contributed a first version with arable crops differentiated by intensity level and tillage type, along with a more detailed machinery module which also considered plot size and mechanization and their respective effect on costs and labour needs. Based on nitrogen response functions, nitrogen loss factors were differentiated for the different intensity and related yield levels. After these extensions the model was renamed to FarmDyn (farm dynamic). David Schäfer, then a master student, developed in 2014 a bio-gas module for the model which reflects the German renewable energy legislation. In 2016, an extension allowing for stochastic programming was added. Since then FarmDyn is a substantial part of several ongoing research projects across Europe. The existing modules are therefore under constant revision and supplemented by new ones.

                        <p>Bernd Lengers and Wolfgang Britz release the first version of the model named DairyDyn. DairyDyn is the result of a research and PhD project financed by the German Science Foundation (DFG) and focuses on the marginal abatement costs of dairy farming. Consequently, dairy farming and GHG accounting are depicted in detail, while the model only has a rudimentary module for arable cropping. The model also includes a first meta-modelling version for the development of a marginal abatement cost function estimation routine including the establishment of experiment runs with design of experiments.</p>

A machinery module differentiates between different plot sizes and mechanisation levels, considering different costs and working time requirements. In addition, the model now takes into account nitrogen response functions and nitrogen loss factors depending on intensity and yields. </p>
