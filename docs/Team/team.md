# History

FarmDyn was initially developed by the Economic Modeling of Agricultural Systems Group of the Institute of Food and Resource Economics at the University of Bonn. The model is under constant development and used for various research projects including external universities and research institutions. In the following the core group of FarmDyn developers is presented below.


## Core group

### PD Dr. agr. Wolfgang Britz

Wolfgang Britz is the head of the working group "Economic Modeling of Agricultural Systems" and contributes to all research on and around FarmDyn. He developed the model and still contributes significantly to the technical and content development of the model. Latest work in FarmDyn includes the development of the calibration module and extension of the risk module with an estimated utility function.

Till Kuhn is a post-doc researcher in the working group "Data Science in Agricultural Economics" at the University of Bonn specialised in environmental policies such as the Agri-Environmental Schemes and Fertilization Ordinance. Latest work includes the implementation of novel technology (e.g. greenRelease) and agri-envrionmental policies.
