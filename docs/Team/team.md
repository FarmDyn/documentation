# Team

FarmDyn was developed by the Economic Modeling of Agricultural Systems Group of the Institute of Food and Resource Economics at the University of Bonn. This working group is continuously researching and developing the model. In addition, scientists from other institutions are working on and with FarmDyn in the context of various research projects. All scientists working on FarmDyn are briefly introduced below.
