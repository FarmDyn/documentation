The dynamic single farm model FarmDyn is the outcome of several, partially on-going research activities. It provides a modular and extendable template model to simulate in detail economically optimal production and investment decisions at single farm scale. FarmDyn depicts various farm branches (arable cropping, pig fattening, piglet production, dairy, beef fattening and biogas plants). Its default layout maximises the deterministic net present value (NPV) over a longer simulation horizon; alternatively, short-run, comparative static or stochastic layouts are available. In the latter case, all variables are state contingent and different types of risk behaviour can be modelled. Integer variables depict indivisibilities in labour use and investment decisions. Constraints reflect in rich detail (1) the inventory of and requirements for machines, stables and other structures, (2) demographic relations between different herds, (3) labour and feed requirements and nutrient flows as well as (4) the financial sphere of the farm, with a temporal resolution between two weeks and a year. The constraints can depict various environmental standards linked to detailed environmental accounting for nitrogen, phosphate and greenhouse-gases (GHG). A state-of-the-art software implementation based on GAMS in combination with MIP industry solvers and a graphical user interface (GUI) allows for efficient analysis. FarmDyn consists of several interacting modules (Figure 1).

The **herd module** captures the intra-temporal demographic relations between different herds (number of animals born, replacement rates, raising periods etc.), at a maximal intra-yearly resolution of single months. The temporal resolution can be increased by aggregation on demand to reduce model size. Herds can be differentiated by animal types - such as cow, heifer, calf -, breeds, and feeding regimes. Cattle animal types can be broken down in different fattening phases. The pig module distinguishes between fattening- and piglet production systems. Fattening pigs are subdivided into different phases to account for different feeding requirements and excretion values. The piglet production system differentiates between sows, young piglets and piglets, which are separated from their mother after two weeks.

The **feed module** distinguishes between pig and cattle feeding requirements. For the different cattle, it captures a cost minimal feed mix from own produced fodder and different types of concentrates at given requirements per head and intra-year feeding periods (energy, protein, dry matter). For pigs it determines a cost minimal feed mix from own produced and purchased fodder and concentrates such as soybean meal and soy oil. For both branches, different feeding phases for reduced nitrogen and phosphorus output can be used.

The **cropping module** optimises the cropping pattern subject to land availability, reflecting yields, prices, machinery and fertilising needs and other variable costs for a selectable list of arable crops. The crops can be differentiated by production system (conventional, organic), tillage type (plough, minimal tillage, no tillage) and intensity level (normal and reduced fertilisation in 20% steps). Machinery use is linked to field working days requirements depicted with a bi-weekly resolution during the relevant months. Crop rotational constraints can be either depicted by introducing crop rotations or by simple maximal shares. The model can capture plots which are differentiated by soil, size and land type (gras, arable).

The **labour module** (not shown in Figure 1) optimises work use on- and off-farm with a monthly resolution, depicting in detail labour needs for different farm operations, herds and stables as well as management requirements for each farm branch and the farm as a whole. Off farm work distinguishes between half and full time work (binaries) and working flexibly for a low wage rate.

The **investment module** depicts investment decisions in machinery, stables and structures (silos, biogas plants, storage) as binary variables with a yearly resolution. Physical depreciation can be based on lifetime or use. Machinery use can be alternatively depicted as continuous re-investment rendering investment costs variable, based on a Euro per ha threshold. Investment can be financed out of (accumulated) cash flow or by credits of different length and related interest rates. For stables and biogas plants, maintenance investment is reflected as well.

Manure excretion from animals is calculated in the **manure module**
based on fixed factors, differentiated by animal type, yield level and feeding practice. For biogas production, the composition of different feed stock is taken into account. Manure can be stored subfloor in stables and in different types of silos. Application of manure has to follow legal obligations and interacts with plant nutrient need from the cropping module. Different N losses are accounted for in stable, storage and during application, differentiating by spreading technology (broadspread, trailing hose etc).

The **environmental accounting module** allows quantifying gaseous emissions of Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). Nitrogen losses in the form of elemental nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) are not considered as emissions but are still a loss from the specified system and therefore part of the environmental accounting. For nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P), soil surface balances are calculated indicating potential nitrate leaching and phosphate losses. Environmental impacts are related to relevant farming operation. Furthermore, emissions are summarized in impact categories using characterization factors from RECIPE (2016).

The **biogas module** defines the economic and technological relations
between components of a biogas plant with a monthly resolution, as well
as links to the farm. Thereby, it includes the statutory payment
structure and their respective restrictions according to the German
Renewable Energy Acts (EEGs) from 2004 up to 2014. The biogas module
differentiates between three different sizes of biogas plants and
accounts for three different lifespans of investments connected to the
biogas plant. Data for the technological and economic parameters used in
the model are derived from KTBL (2013) and FNR (2013). The equations
within the template model related to the biogas module are presented in
the following section.
